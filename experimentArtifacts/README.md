In this repository you can find all materials used in the experiment were elaborated.
====================

We executed an experiment in which we investigate whether the engineers productivity (*time* and *erros*) is different when using two [KDM][fireballKDM] extensions. In this experiment, the subjects had to create and maintain instances of the both KDM-AO extensions previously shown. All the planning was done according to [Wohlin][experiment] guidelines.

We explore the data set that we gathered by addressing the following motivation research question(RQ):

**RQ: Which of the KDM-AO (LW or HW) requires less effort (time) and lead to less errors when creating and maintaining extended KDM instances?**

In this repository the following materials are available:

* Creating Heavyweight instances.docx
	* It shows all steps to create heavyweight instances of KDM-AO.
* Creating Lightweight instances.docx
	* It describes all steps to create Lightweight instances of KDM-AO.
* EXPERIMENT.pptx
	* It provides information about the groups and all activities the subjects had to performed.
* Time table.docx
	* It contains all the data gathered during the experiment.
